## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:joaosviegas/DEI-AMS.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd src/
```

### Database

To run the database with Docker (recommended), run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Alternatively, you can create services that will be run in the background:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop the database, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Backend

Create a copy of the `application-local.properties` file.

```bash
cp ./backend/src/main/resources/application.properties.example ./backend/src/main/resources/application.properties
```

If you're running your database using Docker, the datasource variables should match the ones in `Docker-compose.yml`.

To build and run the backend, execute the following commands:

```bash
cd ./backend
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

## Frontend

Create a copy of the `example.env` file named `.env`.

```bash
cp ./frontend/example.env ./frontend/.env
```

Now, you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
cd ./frontend
npm i
```

To run the frontend, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## MailCrab (Email Testing)

The project uses **[MailCrab](https://github.com/marlonb/mailcrab)** for local email testing.

- MailCrab runs automatically with `docker compose up`.  
- By default, it is available at:  
  - **Web UI:** [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080)  
  - **SMTP Server:** `localhost:1025`

All emails sent by the backend will appear in the MailCrab web interface.

## Access the Database

In order to access the database, you can use the following command (if you're using the provided Docker Compose file, `PORT` should be `7654`, `USER` should be `postgres` and `DB_NAME` should be `deidb`):

```bash
psql -h localhost -p <PORT> -U <USER> <DB_NAME>
```

To populate the database use the following command:

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 7654 -U postgres -d deidb < populate.sql
```
